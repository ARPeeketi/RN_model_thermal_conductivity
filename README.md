# Thermal DEM - RN Model
A Thermal Discrete Element Method (TDEM) framework designed to estimate the effective thermal conductivity of granular beds. This framework operates akin to a resistor network approach, accounting for both contact conduction and gap conduction. Moreover, it addresses the impact of reducing gas pressure on conductivity, known as the Smoluchowski effect.
