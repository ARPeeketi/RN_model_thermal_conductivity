# Thermal DEM - RN Model
A thermal discrete element method (TDEM) based framework to estimate the effective thermal conductivity of granular beds. The framework is similar to a resistor network approach. The contact conduction and the gap conduction are considered. The influence of reducing gas pressure on the conductivity (Smoluchowski effect) is also considered.
